# audiveris

This repository contains source code for the latest generation of Audiveris Optical
Music Recognition (OMR) application.

## Releases

All releases are available on [Audiveris Releases][releases] page.

The most recent stable version is release 5.1, published on December 13, 2018.

## Main features

Derived from Audiveris [earlier generation][audiveris-eg] (4.x versions),
which was limited to fast processing
of small high-quality scores in memory, this repository (starting with Audiveris 5.x versions) is
significantly more ambitious:

* Good recognition efficiency on real-world quality scores (as seen on [IMSLP][imslp] site)
* Effective support for large scores (with up to hundreds of pages)
* Convenient user-oriented interface to detect and correct most OMR errors
* Openness to external access
* Available on Windows, Linux and MacOS

The core of engine music information (OMR data) is fully documented and made publicly available,
either directly via XML-based `.omr` project files or via the Java API of this software:

* Audiveris includes an integrated exporter, which can write a subset of OMR data into
[MusicXML][musicxml] 3.0 format.
* Other exporters are expected to build upon this OMR data to support other target formats.
